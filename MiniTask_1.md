# 15 Project 
## 1. Roll OVA (compact digital rolling ruler)
Aim is to build a distance measuring device using rotary encoder and display the measured distance on LCD display using an Arduino.
### Working:-
Here the mechanical rotational motion is turned into digital signals from which we can get the information like angular velocity ,direction of rotation , angular displacement.These signals are sent to arduino which calulate and display the length covered on LCD display.

### Use:-
Compact and easy to carry.
Can measure the length of curved path also.

## 2.8x8x8 LED cube
Building 8x8x8 LED cube which forms 3D pattern and visual effects using Arduino.
### Working:-
Consider a 8x8 LED here we can't operate all the LED's at the same time using 16 pins only hence leds are glown line by line at a very fast which looks like a 2D pattern due to persistance of vision. Similar concept is applied in 8x8x8 LED cube where 8x8 led planes are grown at a very fast rate formimg a 3D pattern.

### Use:-
Can be used to plot 3D graph.
Can be used for decoration by crating 3D visual effects.
