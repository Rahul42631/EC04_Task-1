# 15 Project 
## 1. Roll OVA (compact digital rolling ruler)
Aim is to build a distance measuring device using rotary encoder and display the measured distance on LCD display using an Arduino.
### Working:-
Here the mechanical rotational motion is turned into digital signals from which we can get the information like angular velocity ,direction of rotation , angular displacement.These signals are sent to arduino which calulate and display the length covered on LCD display.

### Use:-
-Compact and easy to carry.
-Can measure the length of curved path also.
