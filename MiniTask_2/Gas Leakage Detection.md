# Gas Leakage Detection
## Problem Statement
Aim is to create a device which can sense the increase in concentration of gas and alarm everyone using a buzzer via Arduino.

## Ideation and Planning
COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT

1. Arduino nano Microcontroller
Easy to code and small in size but still since it serves several more functionalities the size is too big for project implementaion.
2. Gas sensor

3. LCD display
Easy to use but way too big and heavy for the project.

PIPLINE : Rotary encode --> Microcontroller --> LCD display

IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE

-A new PCB could be designed which serve only those functionalities that the project needs hence the size constrain of the microcontroller could be avoided.

-Sensitivity of rotary encoder could be increased by incresing the teeth in slit disk .

-LCD can be replaced by OLED display which is much more compact, lighter and the quality is far better than LCD.

APPROACH:-

After investigating through all the electrical componets ,circuits and PCB designes we can use fusion 360 ,Eagle,KiCad for designing mechanical structure and PCBs respectively. After coming up with efficient and compact designe it's time for prototyping phase.

## Prototyping
Keeping the over all cost of project in mind its time to implement the ideas by breaking project in smaller parts, if we find any undesired outcome we can go back to ideation stage and work recursively on the problem.
