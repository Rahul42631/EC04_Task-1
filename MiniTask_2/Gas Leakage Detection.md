# Gas Leakage Detection
## Problem Statement
Aim is to create a device which can sense the increase in concentration of gas and print it on a LCD display if the consentration gets higher then safty level it will alarm everyone using a buzzer via Arduino.

## Ideation and Planning
COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT
Gas Sensor --> Microcontroller --> Buzzer

1. Gas sensor 
The MQ-2 smoke sensor is sensitive to smoke and to the following flammable gases:

-LPG

-Butane

-Propane

-Methane

-Alcohol

-Hydrogen

Working:-

)

2. Arduino nano Microcontroller
3. Pizo Buzzer
4. LCD display

Gas Sensor --> Microcontroller --> Buzzer

APPROACH:-

After investigating through all the electrical componets ,circuits and PCB designes we can use fusion 360 ,Eagle,KiCad for designing mechanical structure and PCBs respectively. After coming up with efficient and compact designe it's time for prototyping phase.

## Prototyping
Keeping the over all cost of project in mind its time to implement the ideas by breaking project in smaller parts, if we find any undesired outcome we can go back to ideation stage and work recursively on the problem.
